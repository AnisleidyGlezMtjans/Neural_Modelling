# Neural_Modelling

This tool provides a new modeling to NMM (Neural Mass Models), considering distributed delays and kinetics information studied at three structural brain decomposition (unit, population and system levels). The whole program can be run by the "Main" function and the analysis at each level was incorporated into "neural_unit_level", "neural_population_level" and "neural_system_level" folders respectivelly. Numerical integration was carried out trough Local Lineariation Method (LLM) to increase the program efficiency. These implementations were collected into the "LL_integration" folder and the "MEEG" folder contains the scripts to to graphically display simulations.
